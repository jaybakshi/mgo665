# MGO 665 Technology Entrepreneurship

The course walked us through the process of starting a new technology-based ventureâ€“from idea generation to execution.
Through case analyses, mini lectures, guest speakers, class pitches, and business plan presentations, I got to learn skills in conceptualizing, developing and managing a successful new venture involved in or affected by technological innovation.
These skills were then be applied to a class project focused on the development of a technology-based idea.

Our business idea was called LearnOne - an innovative and all-inclusive platform for UB students to learn, share and socialize not just for academic purposes but also scalable to other campus events etc. We conducted surveys, analyzed the data, decided on the right time and platform for opporunity, prepared a well-calculated business plan and projections to present it in the final project review. We won the 2nd place for this business idea and presentation.
